title: 'Capstone Project: MovieLens'
author: "Dakshina Dhanasekaran"
For this project, I have created a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. I have used the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to reduce the computation time. The MovieLens dataset has ratings given by various users for various movies along with the timestamp of rating, genre of the movie and release year of the movie. Machine learning models were trained using the inputs in one subset to predict movie ratings in the validation set.  The final model chosen is a linear model using regularization by k-fold cross-validation with predictors as movie, user, genre, release year and rating year. The RMSE of this model is 0.8644928
